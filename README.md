# SaberScaler
Mod that allows scaling of the sabers ingame. Note that this mod does not mess around with the hitbox of the sabers therefore allowing score submission to be enabled.

## Prank
This mod has a simple April Fools prank enabled by default, if you do not want this then access the config at `UserData/SaberScaler.json` and change the `Surprise` value from true to false.
